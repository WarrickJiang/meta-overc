OverC runtime
=============

Depending on the selected cubes, the user/application developer runtime varies.

Generally speaking, if either cube-desktop or cube-server have been selected the user
is presented with a enterprise-like, fully featured runtime that is suitable
for development or application deployment.

This includes common tasks such as: package additions, upgrades, local 
development, desktop + utilities, etc. 

cube management
===============

As described by the system overview in the README documentation, an OverC
platform is composed of multiple cubes. These cubes can be collectively, 
or individually, managed and updated.

console
-------

Console access is available through several mechanisms:

 - ssh: when installing a cube, the extraction utilities tests for avahi
	capabilities. If present, the cube is configured to broadcast
	its services though avahi. Standard ssh login restrictions apply,
	and there are no restrictions on inter-cube logins (outside of
	a working network).

	Notes:

	  - avahi can be used to browse and locate active cubes.
	  - the hostname of each cube is used + the cube name in the
	    format of: cube-<build date>-<cube name>. If the hostname
	    or avahi configuration is changed, these defaults no longer
	    apply.

 - vt: The assignents of VTs to cubes are specified in the configuration files
       described in the README documentation. For example:

       HDINSTALL_CONTAINERS="${ARTIFACTS_DIR}/cube-dom0-genericx86-64.tar.bz2:vty=2 \
			     ${ARTIFACTS_DIR}/cube-server-genericx86-64.tar.bz2:vty=3 \
			     ${ARTIFACTS_DIR}/cube-desktop-genericx86-64.tar.bz2:vty=4"

       Once booted, this system would have dom0 on VT2, cube-server on VT3 and cube-desktop
       on VT4.

 - inter-cube pipes: For situations where a network is not available, and physical
		     access to VTs is not possible, OverC provides inter-cube pipe
		     based console access.

		     Since this capbility requires a cube-cmd-server running on the
		     target cube, it is only available from user/application cubes
		     to dom0.

		     Standard authentication through 'login' is used to authenticate
		     access to dom0.

		     Once on dom0, console access can then be granted to any running
		     cube in the system by entering the proper namespace.

                     Access to both types of consoles is provided via the 'cube-console'
                     utility.

access examples:
----------------

ssh:

 # cube-desktop terminal:
 % uname -a | cut -d' ' -f2
cube-01-12-15-cube-desktop

 # connect to dom0
 % ssh root@cube-01-12-15-dom0.local

 # connect to cube-server
 % ssh root@cube-01-12-14-cube-server.local

console:

 Consoles are accessed through standard VT switching mechanisms, such as
 <ctrl>-<alt>-f1 (for cube-essentia), <ctrl>-<alt>-f2 (for dom0), etc, depending
 on the configuration (as described above).

inter-container pipes:

 # find the valid console tarets:
 % cube-ctl list

 # cube-desktop -> dom0
 % cube-console dom0

<login with dom0 credentials>

 # cube-desktop -> cube-server, fails with an [ERROR] message, since cube-server is
 # not a valid inter-container target
 % cube-console cube-server
ERROR: cube is not allowed direct console access. log into dom0 first.

 # dom0 -> cube-server (after logging into dom0), no prompt, since this is
 # an admin -> namespace entry
 % cube-console cube-server 
bash-4.3#


utilities
========

OverC provides utilities for manipulating, querying and managing cubes.
Administrative commands are only allowed on dom0, and if issues from
a non-control cube, an error is returned.

cube-console:
-------------

Provides authenticated console access from user/application cubes to
dom0, and namespace based consoles from dom0 to application cubes.

Available targets can be found via: cube-ctl list

cube-ctl:
---------

  cube-ctl <options> <cmd>

commands (and options):

 cube-ctl start [--peer] [--nested] <name>

    start (launch) a container (dom0 only):

       --peer (default)
       --nested
       <name>: name of the container to be launched

 cube-ctl stop <name>

    stop a container (dom0 only):

       <name>: name of the container to be stoped

 cube-ctl status
 cube-ctl list

    show the status (list) of known containers

 cube-ctl <target>:<command> # (dom0 only):

    execute command <command> against a named target. Either a container
    name should be specified, or "host" for a native command.

 cube-ctl info <name> # (dom0 only):

    display detailed information about container <name>

 cube-ctl restart <name> # (dom0 only):

    restart container <name>. A graceful shutdown and relaunch will be
    performed.

 % cube-ctl cube-server:cat /etc/hostname
